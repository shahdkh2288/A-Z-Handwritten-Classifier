# A-Z-Handwritten-Classifier

A machine learning project to classify handwritten alphabet letters (A-Z) using multiple models, including SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. This project is part of the Machine Learning (Fall 2024) course final assignment.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate various models to classify grayscale images of handwritten alphabets. The dataset consists of 28x28 pixel images for 26 classes (A-Z).

📂 Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format].

🔧 Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
   -  numpy
   -  pandas
   -  matplotlib
   -  scikit-learn
   -  tensorflow

🛠️ Features and Tasks
This project is divided into the following sections:

1. Data Exploration and Preparation:
Identify unique classes and visualize their distribution.
Normalize and preprocess images.
Reconstruct and visualize sample images.

2. SVM Models:
Train two SVM models (linear and nonlinear kernels).
Test the models and evaluate performance using confusion matrices and F1 scores.

3. Logistic Regression:
Implement a one-vs-all multi-class logistic regression model from scratch.
Evaluate the model's performance and visualize error and accuracy trends.

4. Neural Networks:
Design and train two neural networks with different configurations.
Save and reload the best model for testing.
Test the best model using personalized data (team members' names).

📊 Results
The final models will be compared based on their accuracy, confusion matrices, and F1 scores. The best-performing model will be identified and discussed.
